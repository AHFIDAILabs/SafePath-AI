    "so this function automatically assess the vulnerability of survivors based on the curren infromation we have about them. i selected those age brackets because they are naturally at higher risk of harm. i stated the key factors and it looks at the key factors such as the age, employment status, the type of violence they've experinced, who they live with, and whether they belong to a vulnerable group or not. so for each risk factor present the function will assign points, and if teh total score croses a certain threshold, the survivor is flagged as vvulnerable. i also made it to record the specific reasons why they were flagged, so we can easily understsnd wat contributed to therir vulnerability status. so what happened is that evevry yes to a risk factor adds points to a score and the threhsold is 3 so if its above the threshold thats vulnerable "
